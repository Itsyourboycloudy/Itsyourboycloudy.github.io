                <p class="p1">My narrative is about the evolution of Call of Duty Zombies maps, spanning from 16 years. It explores the progression of the story, the locations, and the crews that define the Zombies experience. I selected this topic because I grew up playing COD Zombies, and it’s a franchise I feel deeply connected to. The combination of gameplay, story, and mystery captivated me, and it’s something that shaped a lot of my interests. </p>

                <p class ="p1">COD Zombies is more than just a game to me; it’s a shared experience with friends, a place of nostalgia, and a narrative that has grown with me over the years. I wanted to explore how the maps evolved in complexity and storytelling over time. I also wanted to highlight the connections between different crews and locations to show how they weave together into a larger narrative. Additionally, I was curious to see how each map contributes to the overarching themes of survival, sacrifice, and mystery in the COD Zombies storyline. To collect the data for my narrative, I used a mix of resources to ensure accuracy and depth. I watched videos from COD Zombies content creators who analyze the story, gameplay, and map design in detail. I also referenced wikis, which provide breakdowns of each map, including locations, story elements, and gameplay mechanics. Finally, I tested things in-game myself to experience the maps firsthand and confirm details like layouts, easter eggs, and character interactions. This combination of sources allowed me to compile a thorough and personal understanding of the Zombies narrative.</p>
